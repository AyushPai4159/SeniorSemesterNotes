Day 2:

- The 3 Ps: People, Process, and Product

	- Its a product, not a program

Fundamental Steps:
	- Requirements, design, implementation, test, deployemnet, maintenance


	- english is ambiguous, so make stuff precise and compact



Three fundamental processes
- Waterfall: do it once, traditional model, used for large projects (limited, heavy process) 
- Spiral: Risk based, iterative but large releases
- Iterative: many iterations, and each iteration is on a fixed cycle
