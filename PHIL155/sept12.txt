Sept 12:


Arguement is valid iff there's no row where all premises are true while the conclusion is false



A wff is  
	- tautology iff: its true on every row
	- contradiction iff: its false on every row
	- contingency iff: its neither a tautology nor a contradiction


A set of wffs is consistent iff: there is at least one row on which all of them are true together
