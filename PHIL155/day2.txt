Day 2:



Key Terms:
- Argument: someone is trying to convince you of something; quarrel 
- Inference: someone is infering 
- Premise: 
- Conclusion: the conclusion
- Derivation: proving the arguement with a series of steps (a proof)
- Form
- Validity: deductive validity, logical validity
	- valid: necessarily truth-preserving in virtue of its form

- Contradiction (True premises, False conclusion)

- dialtheism: a proposition can be both true and false


Enthymeme: Arguement where one or more premises are left out because they are assumed

Categorical syllogisms: two premises, three classes/subjects (cats, mammals, vertebrates), each premises works with 2 of 3 categories
	- Ex: All cats are mammals, all mammals are vertebrates -> all cats are vertebrates


Existential Import: All cats can swim -> Some cats can swim
	- without existential import, all cats can swim can be true with 0 cats


Logical Implication vs Pragmatic Implication
	- LI: one statement logically implies another statement if it implies

	- PI: one statement logically follow to another because of practical reality
		- Example is below
	- Example: JTR: Its not raining
		- Therefore, JTR believes that its not raining

	This example works for PI, but not LI
