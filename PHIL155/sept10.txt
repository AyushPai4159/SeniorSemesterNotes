9/10:




Properties of a single wff:


- Tautology - The wff is true regardless of combinations of boolean variables
- Contradiction - The wff is false regardless of combinations of boolean variables
- Contingency - The wff is false/true depending on combinations of boolean variables


Relations with other wffs:

- equivalence - Two wffs are logically equivalent iff they have the same truth values on every row
- consistency - some wffs are consistent if there is at least one row where they are all true 
- entailment - a wff "a" entails a wff "b" iff: there is now row where "a" is true but "b" is false
	- "a" entails "b" iff a -> b is a tautology
	- "a" entails "b" iff a * ~b is a contradiction
