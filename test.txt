Permutations and Combinations:



Suppose we have 3 history boooks and 4 math books. in how many ways can we arrange them on a bookshelf?
	- 7!


What if we want all math books together and all history books next to each other: 2 * 3! * 4!



Combinations: nCk = (n! / ((k)!(n-k)!)



factorials aren't good in computation
