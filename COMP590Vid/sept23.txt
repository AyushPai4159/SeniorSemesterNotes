Notes:


Weaknesses of the 2nd paper:

- assumed a certain level of resources/context

- didn't separate their toolkit for feedback from the player as an application

- didn't demonstrate or explain how it could be applied to other apps

- how are they avoiding dropping an I or P frame

	- is it always possible to seperate the feedback movement from the details of the system under control






Window of Scarcity:

- an innovation is possible in the window of scarcity if done cleverly with scarce resources
