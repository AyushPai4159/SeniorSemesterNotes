Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Point Cloud Codec for Tele-Immersive Video:

- codec: compressor-decoder component


Abstract:

- presenting a codec for mixed-reality



Introduction 
- 3D point clouds are incredibly effective for mixed/augmented reality
- but sending millions of points across a network requires good compression

- much work in the past has been done to compress points progressively, giving lower quality 3d point graphs with partial bit streams
- compression rate to geometric distortion was used to compare performance b/w solutions
- parallelizability of processes is important for performance
- better compression performance via intra prediction
- codec requires both subjective and objectively quality assessments from the users


- team introduces new codec that works for time-varying 3d point graphs for augmented/immersive video
