VR Codec Summary:

I. Introduction

- 3D point rendering has many applications in mixed reality systems

- "3D point clouds are a useful representation for 3D video streams in mixed reality systems"

- "However, realistic reconstructed 3D point clouds may contain hundreds of thousands up to millions of points, and compression is critical to achieve efficient and real-time communication in bandwidth-limited networks."

- in comparing solutions to compression of 3D point clouds, we used metrics compression rate, geometric distortion, and algorithmic complexity

- but real-time performance is also important

- introduces a time-varying codec that works on dynamic 3D points, which initially was static in previous codecs

- "With these requirements in mind, we introduce a codec for time-varying 3D point clouds for augmented and immersive 3D video.

- "Therefore, to enable true convergence between naturalistic and synthetic contents in immersive and augmented reality, object-based video compression of point clouds and
3D meshes remains a challenge." 

- "To illustrate this need further, we show some examples from a practical tele-immersive
system that we have been working on in the last four years, the Reverie system"
