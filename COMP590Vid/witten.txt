Notes on witten text:


- model is a way of calculating, in any given context, the distribution of probabilities to output the next input symbol. 


- it is impossible to encode bits of a message less than that of the entropy of said message

Arithemtic Encoding is more flexible than Huffman encoding, especially for encoding symbols with probabilites close to one

- how does decoding the range work in arithmetic encoding

- What does symbol - 1 mean in the arithmetic encoding alg. 


def encode_symbol(symbol, model, I/O device):
	range_width = high - low + 1
	(prob-start, prob-end) = model.interval(symbol)
	low = low + floor(range-width * prob-start)
	high = low + floor(range-width * prob-end) - 1
