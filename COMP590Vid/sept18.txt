Sept 18:



- Live/Interactive vs Broadcast/On-Demand

	- former to reduce delay
	- latter is prerecorded that are delay tolerant, supporting scale




- problems with delay:

	- sampling delay: 
	- compress delay:
	- packetization
	- transmission: router buffer accepts packets and transmit them into another 
		- could be a bottleneck path
		- delay is sum of buffer queue delay
	- reception delay 





TCP/IP -> provides a narrow-waste interface
	- IP: best effort datagram machine to machine
		- must deliver at least one package from one machine to another
	- TCP: reliable byte stream, with every packet being connected to each other
		- assigns every packet with a specific program or purpose on a machine
		- port numbers
		- packet numbers
		- acknowledgement scheme
		- congestion control



	- Jitter: Variance of Delay

	- congestion window = cong. + (1/cong.)



- DASH -> current format for streaming

	- progressive downloading

	- ABR -> available bitrate streaming
 
	- Netflix uses bitrate ladder to transmit 30 seconds blocks with a quality ranging from 20+ versions
