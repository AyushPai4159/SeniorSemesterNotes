I-frames: block of pixel use DC Transform to convert pixels into frequencies


- every macroblock has a past reference to the reconstructed image block
	- search for the closest block using sum of Absolute Differences



- What is the difference between an I and P block?




- quantization of the residual is where the video data loss occurs




- MPEG2 - greater control managing reference frames
	- partition motion block to identify more specific/closer frames of reference


- Subsampling - lossy



- Transform Coding: Transforming pixels into frequencies - lossless



- Rolling List Encoding: Specific to encoding predicable values/characters within strings/lists of characters -> lossless


- Pred. Encoding -> lossless


- Quantization: should affect residual added to a compressed frame -> lossy
