1. MPEG Brief Look

	- using MPEG1, playback is smooth if all or only a few frames needed to be decoded. This can be improved
	- Goal: To integrate software-decoded MPEG streams into continuous playback systems, and anazlyze the quality of the streams.

	- "Initially, this system supported 8kHz 8-bit audio and hardware-assisted motion JPEG compressed video streams.This paper describes the integration of a software decoded MPEG-i video stream into this system."
	- CMS is the source of the video data
	- CMPlayer is an application for video playback
	- CMX decodes the packets sent from UDP
	- X Display outputs the decoded packets
	- Audio Device outputs the decoded packets
	- In playback, I frames are prioritized then P, then B
	
	- Playing Backwards is difficult, because if you have a B frame at the moment, you must decode an arbitrary I and P frames that the B frame is based on. 

	

2. Distributed MPEG System Brief Look
	- Due to the internet's diversity of workload stations and random/dynamic access to media, we need a new client/server synchronization method.
	- Instead of a software-feedback system that is developed ad-hoc and hardcoded to work for specific applications, make it more generalized by using a toolkit-based approach
