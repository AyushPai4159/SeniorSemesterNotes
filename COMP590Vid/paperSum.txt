1. MPEG Brief Look

	- using MPEG1, playback is smooth if all or only a few frames needed to be decoded. This can be improved
	- Goal: To integrate software-decoded MPEG streams into continuous playback systems, and anazlyze the quality of the streams.

	- "Initially, this system supported 8kHz 8-bit audio and hardware-assisted motion JPEG compressed video streams.This paper describes the integration of a software decoded MPEG-i video stream into this system."


2. Distributed MPEG System Brief Look
	- Due to the internet's diversity of workload stations and random/dynamic access to media, we need a new client/server synchronization method.
	- Instead of a software-feedback system that is developed ad-hoc and hardcoded to work for specific applications, make it more generalized by using a toolkit-based approach
