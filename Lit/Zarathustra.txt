HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING:



- a reflection of Nietzsche's high and low points in life

- Zarathrusta is part of Persian mythos

- prided in individualism and the few great people

- loves the Greco-Roman philosophies and despises Christianity for creating "weak" people


- Uses Superhuman as a contradiction to old moral values, where now values are truely being questions and deeply analyzed, instead living by moral pretense
