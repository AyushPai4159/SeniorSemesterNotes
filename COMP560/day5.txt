Day 5:



- The heuristic should not over-estimate the goal



relaxed heuristic - find an easier solution by making a few moves, and then convert your problem to get a better heuristic to the goal state
	- ask this



Tree Search: extra work:
	- failure to detect repeated states can lead to exponentially more work



h(n) <= cost(n, n') + h(n') for all n, n'


is A* optimal: Tree search (yes if heuristic is admissible), Graph Search (yes consistent and admissible)


Iterative deepening A* (IDA *) -> like IDS but change f-cost as budget for each iteration






Adversarial Search:


- Games as Search
- Zero-sum games
	- Minimax algorithm
	- a - B pruning

- Incorporating uncertainty



Zero-Sum Games:

- agents have opposite utilities



Minimax adversarial search


- playing with worst-possible case scenario path


time complexity - O(b^m)
