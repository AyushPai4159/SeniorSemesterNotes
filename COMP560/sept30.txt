Linear Regression:


- What is regression
	- predicing a real-value (scalar) output based on a set of input features


y = (w^T * x) + b


- can be thought of as one-layer neural network


large w values are bad because they might overfit the training values, so new values can't be predicted as well. 


- use a lambda minimization function to reduce the slope of the LSRL
