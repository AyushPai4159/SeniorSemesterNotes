Bayes Rule :


P(A | B) = 

Given P(A /\ B)/P(B)


P (A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A))/P(B) 





Applications of Bayes Rule for ML:


- P(h): prior probability of hypothesis h. Reflects background knowledge; before data is observed. If no information,
uniform distribution


P(D) - probability that sample of data is observed


P(D|h): probability of observing sample D, given hypothesis h is the target

P(h | D): the posterior probability of h. The probability that h is given
