Probability: Informally, a calculus of uncertainities


P(e) = Ne / N -> N is number of equally likely outcomes given e occurs Ne times


An event E is a subset of S



Takeaway: Probability is a function that maps events in the outcome space to the interval of [0,1]


Axioms of probability:

- All probabilities lie in [0,1]
- Total probability of all possible outcomes is 1
- Probabiltiy of Union of Events is the sum of the probabilites of each

P(Y) = sum of joint probabilites of Y and Xi from i to k
	- e.g. P(Y) = P(Y, x = v1) + P(Y, X=v2) + ... P(Y | X = vk)



Bayes Rule: given P(B) > 0 then:


P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A))/P(B)
