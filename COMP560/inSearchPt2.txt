Informed Search Part 2:



- a heuristic is admissible if 0 <= h(n) <= h*(n)

	- h(n) is heuristic
	- h*(n) is true cost to the goal



- to get an admissible heuristic, used an easier/relaxed version of the problem
	- e.g. 8 tile
		1. Can move tile from Pos. A to Pos. B if B is next to A (ignoring if spot is blank)
		2. Can move tile from Pos. A to Pos. B if B is blank (ignoring adjacency)
		3. Can move tile from Pos. A to Pos. B




What if the heuristic is the actual cost - Unrealistic and more computation as heuristic gets closer to the goal cost


Proof on A* Optimality:

- Assume Suboptimal goal node B is on the fringe at a specific point of traversal
- before B can possible get expanded, node N, and ancestry of optimal goal node A, will be expanded first since:
	1. f(n) <= f(A)
	2. f(A) < f(B)	
	3. n expands before B

- all ancestors of A expand before B, therefore A will be reached first 
- therefore, A* is optimal
