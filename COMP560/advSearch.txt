Adversarial Search:


- Types of Games
	- deterministic or stochastic
	- perfect information (can you see the state)?
	- one, two, or more players?
	- turn-taking?
	- zero sum (tie)?


- Minimax Search
	- A state-space search tree
	- Players alternate turns
	- Compute each node's minimax value: the best achievable utility against a rational adversary

- player 1 wants to maximize results based on the max of its successors
- player 2 wants to maximize results based on the min of its successors

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Time complexity: O(b^m)

Space complexity: O(bm)

Complete: Yes if tree is finite

Optimal - Yes against an optimal opponent

Alpha-Beta Pruning:


- Pruning a MIN node's children
	- If we are pruning a min node's children
		- let a be the best value that a max node can get at any choice point along current path
		- if the current node's min value is less than a, max will avoid it

- vise versa with pruning MAX node's children
