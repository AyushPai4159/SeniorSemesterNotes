Informed Search:


- heuristic - approximate cost to get to the goal
- h(n) = 0 when n is a goal node
	- otherwise h(n) >= 0


---------------------------------------------
- greedy best-first search

	- expand the unexpanded node with lowest h-value
	- time complexity: O(b^m) -> given m is finite
	- space complexity: O(b^m)
---------------------------------------------

- A* Search

	- a combination of UCS and Greedy
	- g(n) is cost of path to node n
	- h(n) is estimate of reaching goal from node n
	- f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
	- When to terminate A* -> when we dequeue a goal (after expanding it)


- inadmissible heuristics: pessimistic heuristics that break optimality by trappingood paths at the fringe


- admissible heuristics: optimistic heuristics that will never outweigh the true costs



- a heuristic is admissible if 0 <= h(n) <= h*(n)

	- h(n) is heuristic
	- h*(n) is true cost to the goal



- to get an admissible heuristic, used an easier/relaxed version of the problem
	- e.g. 8 tile
		1. Can move tile from Pos. A to Pos. B if B is next to A (ignoring if spot is blank)
		2. Can move tile from Pos. A to Pos. B if B is blank (ignoring adjacency)
		3. Can move tile from Pos. A to Pos. B




What if the heuristic is the actual cost - Unrealistic and more computation as heuristic gets closer to the goal cost


Proof on A* Optimality:

- Assume Suboptimal goal node B is on the fringe at a specific point of traversal
- before B can possible get expanded, node N, and ancestry of optimal goal node A, will be expanded first since:
	1. f(n) <= f(A)
	2. f(A) < f(B)	
	3. n expands before B

- all ancestors of A expand before B, therefore A will be reached first 
- therefore, A* is optimal
