Informed Search:


- heuristic - approximate cost to get to the goal
- h(n) = 0 when n is a goal node
	- otherwise h(n) >= 0


---------------------------------------------
- greedy best-first search

	- expand the unexpanded node with lowest h-value
	- time complexity: O(b^m) -> given m is finite
	- space complexity: O(b^m)
---------------------------------------------

- A* Search

	- a combination of UCS and Greedy
	- g(n) is cost of path to node n
	- h(n) is estimate of reaching goal from node n
	- f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
	- When to terminate A* -> when we dequeue a goal (after expanding it)


- inadmissible heuristics: pessimistic heuristics that break optimality by trappingood paths at the fringe


- admissible heuristics: optimistic heuristics that will never outweigh the true costs
